    to showcase data science skills in creating a sports analytics app
    #### Method:
    - scrape SP probables from two sites (Rotogrinders and BaseballPress)
    - scrape team batting stats from Baseball Reference via pybaseball package
    - scrape pitcher stats from Baseball Reference via pybaseball package
    - calculate expected strikeout distributions for each pitcher
    - use API to pull over / under prop bets from FanDuel
    - calculate expected value for each pitcher
