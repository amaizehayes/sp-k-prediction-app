    ### Objective:
    Showcase my sports analytics data science skills for future employers while creating an app for personal use.

    ### Summary of App:
    To identify value in the strikeout prop bet market for starting pitchers, and produce a streamlit app to display the data.

    The app displays the expected strikeout values and distributions for each pitcher and compares it to the over / under prop bet line based on these expected strikeout amounts.

    ### Navigating the App:
    **SPK App:** Home page with five tabs of data being displayed:
    - **Expected Ks**: Expected K predictions for each pitcher with their prop bet line
    - **K Distributions**: Poisson strikeout distributions for each pitcher
    - **Over / Under Bets**: Expected value for each pitcher's over / under prop bet
    - **Most K Odds**: Expected moneyline for each pitcher's most strikeouts prop bet
    - **Results**: Results of the previous day's games. Plenty more to come here.

    **About:** This page

    **Roadmap:** Future iterations of the app

    ### Approach Details (deatils a work in progress):
    - scrape probable starting pitchers from Rotogrinders and BaseballPress
    - scrape left and right team heandedness batting stats from MLB.com
    - scrape previous day pitcher stat lines from Baseball Reference
    - use API to pull over / under prop bets from FanDuel
    - use pybaseball to return pitcher stats for each probable starting pitcher
    - run calculation based on SP K%, SP average inning pitched, SP average batters faced per inning and normalized team handedness K%
    - calculate expected strikeout Poisson distributions for each pitcher
    - caculate sum of over or under Poisson distributions for each pitcher based on prop bet line
    - compare expected value to prop bet line over or under
    - identify over and under bets with most exepected value
    - use expected Ks data to simulate 10000 games and determine moneyline odds for pitcher with most Ks on the day
    - update yesterday's results from Baseball Reference stat line log
    - connect data to Streamlit to display all data which runs from GitHub repo
    - integrate PythonAnywhere to run scripts daily and update app (including pulling and pushing to GitHub)
